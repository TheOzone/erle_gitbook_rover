You have to repeat this process twice:you should screw two motors to each side plate. Be careful with the position of the motors(looking to the inside part). Also, note the order when screwing: first the washer, second the spring washer and last the nut.

After having done this, take eigth pieces of wire and tie them to the metal-holes in the motors(two wire pieces for each motor).Then,for better fixation, weld the wires with a bit of tin.You can get support in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9lQ-wKoXo).
