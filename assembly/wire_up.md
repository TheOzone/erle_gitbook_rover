# Wire up NEED REVISION


First of all you have to take the two wires: the red-wire coming for the battery pack and the middle wire coming from the switch. You have to connect them, so **twist them together** and cover them with a tape layer.
Like this:

Now your power wires become the black-wire coming from the battery and the ON-wire coming from the switch.

Then, **identify** one side motors with scotch tape, to be able to differentiate between the right and the left motors..

Finally **remember to connect the cells**. WE USE LIPO BATTERY SO THIS FILE SHOULD BE CHANGED.
